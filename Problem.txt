A prime number is an integer (other than 1) that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6. Write an application that calculates and stores the first 100 prime numbers (starting at 2) in a list. Use an iterator to display the numbers.
